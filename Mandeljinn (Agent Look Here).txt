Mandeljinn is a fractal music explorer inspired by Fractal Music Generator (FMG) by BetaZeta

Goals:
1. Implement generation, panning and zooming of the Mandelbrot Set and othe fractals supported by FMG.
    a. Identify the fractals supported by FMG and the formulas used to generate them.
    b. Implement each fractal supported by FMG in mandeljinn.

2. Implement multiple control combinations using NORNS Key Buttons (K1, K2, K3) and Encoders (E1, E2, E3)
    a. E1 - Zoom In-Out (CW/CCW)
    b. E2 - Pan Left-Right (CW/CCW) (Direction Subject to Change)
    C. E3 - Pan Up-Down (CW/CCW) (Direction Subject to Change)
    d. K1+E1 - Scroll Select Fractal (HUD Activates and displays
        current selection highlighted black text on white background.
        Ohter selections above and below are white text on black background)
    e. K2+E1 - Increase/Decrease (CW/CCW) Orbit Position Note Execution Tempo 
    f. K2+E2 - Increase/Decrease (CW/CCW) Number of Orbit Positions to Play in Loop
    g. K2+E3 - Increase/Decrease (CW/CCW)
    h. K3+E1 - Increase/Decrease (CW/CCW)
    i. K3+E2
    j. K3+E3
    k. K2+K3+E1
    l. K2+K3+E2
    m. K2+K3+E3
    n. K1 Short Press-Release - Toggle between NORNS SELECT/SYSTEM/SLEEP Menu
        Screen and Patch Canvas. Pause Playing while viewing menu.
    o. K2 Short Press-Release - Add current Orbit Origin Point and its Parameters to Play Sequence List
    p. K3 Short Press-Release - Delete most recently added Origin Origin Point Entry from Play Sequence List
